### If you're already using [Material UI v5](https://material-ui.com), why not display your images according to the Material guidelines too?

> Illustrations and photographs may load and transition in three phases at staggered durations, rather than relying on opacity changes alone.
>
> Visualize the image fading in, like a print during the photo development process.

## About the fork

Alter from alternative.

I actually just to make a fork with small modification for my website but somehow I ended changed many things... How it became like this?

### Why should I use this?

If you satisfied with original project, you probably not need this. This is for users with a specific need.

To put it simply, you only needed this if:

- You want to change the component root element, `img` with other component like `Image` from `next/image`.
- You want to use `styled` function from `styled-components` or `emotion`  or `MUI` on `Image` component but noticed some style not working properly.[^1]

[^1]: This happen on original project because the styles set using style prop. To correct this for original project, you need to use style or wrapperStyle or iconWrapperStyle that provided to overwrite the default style.

### Changes in this fork

- Breaking Changes
  - Height and width prop forwarded to the component root element (by default, `img`) instead of using CSS to set height and width of component wrapper element. Some alternate image components like `next/image` actually need for height and width prop.
  - Put all styles that set though style prop in styled for better compability with MUI's styled.
  - No UMD build. Go post an issue if you want UMD to be added.
  - Only named exports. Read this [article](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#default-interop).

- Other Changes
  - Rewritten fully in Typescript with types built-in based on MUI component types.
  - Add support to MUI's component prop; That's means you can subtitute component root element with `Image` from `next/image` if you want. Component supported are `img`, `img`-derived HTML element and component with `src` prop.
  - Properly export esm and cjs build via package.json exports.

- Development Changes
  - Use Vite instead of nwb for development and building the library for fast and better developer experience for me!
  - Added unit tests for testing mui-image-alter component. Also, added new Github Action that will automatically run these tests every pull request.

## Simple Q & A

- **Q**: Why you created this fork?  
  **A**: MUI's styled don't work very well with the original mui-image because some of default styling and it use style prop instead of using styled to set some of the styling. So, I want to modify a little bit... And I end up doing at lot.  
  Originally, I want to just post an issue for this but I am suck in comunication. 😅

- **Q**: Why you change nwb to Vite?  
  **A**: I just wanted to fork for my own benefit. So, I thought maybe I can write this in TypeScript... but it don't work with nwb. I am so frustrated that I cannot find how to do it and try migarating to Vite instead. (Also, looks like nwb is abandoned too...) It took a lot of work but never thought it work so well...
  Maybe there is actually a way to use Typescript with nwb but I never regret switching to Vite.

  Vite is so fast!!! 😍

- **Q**: Will you intergrate changes from the original project?  
  **A**: Yeah. As many as possible. 💪

### 1. Install

Install the `mui-image-alter` peer dependencies first. (Can skip if you already done it.)

If you haven't yet install MUI, please follow the [official guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/). Only MUI v5 or v6 are supported. 

Now, you can install the `mui-image-alter`.

#### Install from npm

[View library details on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mui-image-alter)

```bash
npm install mui-image-alter
```

```bash
yarn add mui-image-alter
```

#### Install from repository

Recommended to specify a version tag like this for installation from the repository like below for stability.

```bash
npm install github:mddanish00/mui-image-alter#vx.x.xx
```

```bash
yarn add mui-image-alter@github:mddanish00/mui-image-alter#vx.x.xx
```

Replace `x.x.xx` with actual tags from [here](https://github.com/mddanish00/mui-image-alter/tags).

### 2. Use

```jsx
import { Image } from 'mui-image-alter';

// then

<Image src="my-image.png" />
```

### 3. Profit 💰

_Note: Profits not guaranteed and Material UI v5 or v6 is a peer dependency. If you need to support legacy versions of Material UI, use [`material-ui-image`](https://github.com/TeamWertarbyte/material-ui-image) instead. See the [comparison chart](#comparison-with-similar-components) below for more._

## Usage Examples

You can use `mui-image-alter` like a regular image.

```jsx
<Image src="my-image.png" />
```

Except... it will fade and animate in as the Material guidelines recommend. 🤯

Apply the `showLoading` prop to add a progress indicator to let your fans know something amazing is coming. You can use the default MUI indicator or bring your own. 😎

```jsx
<Image src="my-image.png" showLoading />
<Image src="my-image.bmp" showLoading={<MyCustomSpinner />} />
```

If you want the image to fail silently you can disable the `errorIcon`, or you can add your own to suit your brand.

```jsx
<Image src="my-cats.png" errorIcon={null} />
<Image src="my-dogs.png" errorIcon={<MyErrorIcon />} />
```

If you want to _disobey Google_ 😵 then you can customise the animation and speed via the `duration` and `easing` props to any valid CSS property. Duration is always milliseconds.

```jsx
<Image src="my-fish.png" duration={325} />
<Image src="my-bird.jpg" easing="ease-in-out" />
```

To add that extra bit of spice 🌶 you can do exactly what Google suggests and apply a small position `shift` to images as they appear. The direction, distance, and duration (in milliseconds) are up to you.

```jsx
<Image src="my-lawd.png" shift="left" />
<Image src="my-gawd.jpg" shift="bottom" distance={300} />
<Image src="my-gosh.gif" shift="top" distance="2rem" shiftDuration={320} />
```

And of course, you can style `mui-image` like you would a regular image... but with the addition of the MUI v5 `sx` prop and [all the benefits](https://mui.com/system/the-sx-prop/) it brings. 😏

```jsx
<Image src="my-self.jpeg" style={{ borderRadius: 16 }} />
<Image src="my-wife.webp" className="custom-class" />
<Image src="my-exgf.tiff" sx={{ display: { sm: 'none', lg: 'inline' }}} />
```

If you want to get fancy 💃 you can also add inline styles and additional `className`'s to the root wrapper `div` and loading/error icon wrapper `div`, or just target their default `className`'s. This allows for complete customisation of every aspect of the component.

### Fork Exclusive Usage

With this fork, you can use MUI's styled normally like this. More info on MUI's [official doccumentation](https://mui.com/system/styled/).

```ts
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { Image } from 'mui-image-alter';

const customImage = styled(Image)({
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 100%;
    display: block;
    max-height: 500px;
});
```

You also can use composition to create custom components.

```ts
import { Image, ImageProps } from 'mui-image-alter';

const customImage = ({ className, ...props }: MuiImageProps) => (
  <Image className="some-custom-class" {...props} />
);
```

You also can extend the props by importing props.

```ts
import React from 'react';
import { Image, ImageProps } from 'mui-image-alter';

type CustomImageProps = ImageProps & {
  customImage: string;
};

const customImage = ({ customImage, src, ...props }: CustomImageProps) => {
  const imageSrc = () => {
    if (customImage === 'grass') {
      return 'https//www.picture.org/grass.png';
    }

    if (customImage === 'beach') {
      return 'https//www.picture.org/beach.png';
    }

    return 'https//www.picture.org/none.png';
  };
  return <Image src={imageSrc()} {...props} />;
};
```

You can also change the component root element like official MUI components. Only img or img-derived component are supported from time being.

```ts
import React, { ElementType } from 'react';
import { Image, ImageProps } from 'mui-image-alter';
import NextImage from 'next/image';

type CustomImageProps = ImageProps<typeof NextImage> & {
  customImage: string;
};

const customImage = ({
  customImage,
  src,
  ...props
}: CustomImageProps) => {
  const imageSrc = () => {
    if (customImage === 'grass') {
      return 'https//www.picture.org/grass.png';
    }

    if (customImage === 'beach') {
      return 'https//www.picture.org/beach.png';
    }

    return 'https//www.picture.org/none.png';
  };
  return <Image src={imageSrc()} component={NextImage} {...props} />;
};
```

Used in the same way as the sx prop in other MUI components. Check out [MUI official documentation](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/) of the `sx` prop.           |
| component            | string / node    |                              | Allows the user to specify a custom element to use as the root element for the Image component. Used in the same way as the component prop in other MUI components. Should only be used with elements that are derived from the `img` element.                                                 |

\* required prop

Any other props (eg. `src`, `alt`, `onLoad`) are passed directly to the root image element like `img`.

## Material guidelines for loading images

> #### ✅ Fade-in
>
> Visualize the image fading in, like a print during the photo development process.

> #### ✅ Opacity, exposure, and saturation recommendations
>
> Images should begin loading with low contrast levels and desaturated color. Once image opacity reaches 100%, display the image with full-color saturation.

> #### ✅ Duration
>
> A longer duration is recommended for loading images, and a shorter duration is recommended for transitions.

> #### ✅ Animation
>
> Add a small position shift to loading images.
